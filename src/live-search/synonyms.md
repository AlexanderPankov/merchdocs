For Magento Commerce installations with Live Search installed, Live Search Synonyms replaces the standard Magento [Search Synonyms](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/search-synonyms.html) functionality, although both appear in the _SEO & Search_ section of the Magento Marketing menu. If you are using Live Search synonyms, follow the Live Search instructions instead.

Synonyms expand search to include words that shoppers might use that differ from those in your catalog. You don't want to lose a sale because someone is looking for a "sofa", while your product is listed as a "couch". You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words customers might use to find your products. Keep in mind the following best practices to get the most from Live Search synonyms. 

- Periodically review the [search terms](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/search-terms.html) people use and add them to your Live Search synonym list.

- Be consistent with the way terminology is used in your catalog. Keep in mind that there might be regional differences in usage, and sometimes within an industry. 

- If you have a mixture of singular and plural terms in your catalog, Search will find the correct set of products. It is not necessary to enter a different form of the word as a synonym.
