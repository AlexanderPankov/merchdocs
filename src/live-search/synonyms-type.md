One- and two-way synonyms expand the definition of a keyword. Some words are interchangeable with a keyword, while others represent a subset of a keyword.

## Two-way

Two-way synonyms have the same meaning and return the same search results. In the following example, the first word shown in bold is the keyword that is used in the catalog, followed by words that have the same meaning as the original keyword. You can create a simple pair of two-way synonyms, or a chain of multiple two-way synonyms for the same keyword.

pants ![Two-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-two-way.png %}) slacks ![Two-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-two-way.png %}) trousers

## One-way

A one-way synonym is a subset of a keyword, but with a more specific meaning. For example, capris and shorts are pants, but not all pants are capris or shorts. A search for pants includes capris and shorts. However, a search for shorts does not include all pants.
