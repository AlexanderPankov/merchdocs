The Live Search module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Magento installation as a service. For instructions, see Live Search in the Magento Developer documentation.

To establish the connection between Live Search and your installation, the Magento license holder can either share access to the API Portal tab of their Magento account, or give the API Key and its download file to a trusted developer or system integrator who will complete the configuration of Magento services.

When the installation and configuration is complete, Live Search appears on the Marketing menu under SEO & Search in the Magento Admin. You must go to Live Search from the Magento Admin to trigger indexation.

- In the Admin, go to **Marketing** > SEO & Search > **Live Search**.

   The synchronization between the product catalog and the catalog service begins after Live Search is connected.
