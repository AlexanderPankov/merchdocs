The Live Search module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Adobe Commerce installation as a service. For instructions, see [Install Live Search]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/install.html) in the developer documentation.

To establish the [connection]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/config-connect.html) between Live Search and your installation, the Adobe Commerce license holder can either [share access]({% link magento/magento-account-share.md %}) to the API Portal tab of their Adobe Commerce account, or give the [API Key]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/marketplace/eqp/v1/access-keys.html) and its download file to a trusted developer or system integrator who will complete the configuration of Adobe services.

When the installation, connection, and configuration of [Commerce Services]({% link configuration/services/saas.md %}) are complete, Live Search appears on the _Marketing_ menu under _SEO & Search_ in the Adobe Commerce Admin.
