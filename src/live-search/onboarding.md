The Live Search module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Adobe Commerce installation as a service. For instructions, see [Install Live Search](https://devdocs-beta.magento.com/live-search/install.html) in the developer documentation.

To establish the connection between Live Search and your installation, the Adobe Commerce license holder can either share access to the API Portal tab of their Adobe Commerce account, or give the API Key and its download file to a trusted developer or system integrator who will complete the configuration of Adobe services.

When the installation and [configuration](https://devdocs-beta.magento.com/live-search/config-connect.html) is complete, Live Search appears on the Marketing menu under SEO & Search in the Adobe Commerce Admin. You must go to Live Search from the Admin to trigger indexation.

- In the Admin, go to **Marketing** > SEO & Search > **Live Search**.

   The synchronization between the product catalog and the catalog service begins after Live Search is connected.
