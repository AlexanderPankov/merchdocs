With a focus on speed, relevance, and ease of use, Live Search is a game changer for shoppers and merchants alike. Follow along for a quick tour of Live Search from the storefront.

### Search as you type

Live Search responds as shoppers type queries into the [Search]({% link catalog/search-quick.md %}) box with suggestions and a thumbnail image of the top results in a popover. Shoppers can go immediately to the [product detail]({% link quick-tour/product-page.md %}) page by clicking a featured suggested product or image.

### Infinite scroll

When shoppers click _View all_ from the Live Search popover, additional items appear naturally as the shopper scrolls down the page. There is no need to navigate through pages of static search results.

Notice that a search box with the current query appears just above the results. Simply change the query in that box to instantly update the results.

### Filtered search with facets

The Filters list in the left sidebar shows the available values derived from the current set of returned products. Filtered search uses multiple dimensions of attribute values, or [facets]({% link live-search/facets.md %}), as search criteria. The selection of filters is defined by the merchant and changes according to the products returned, with the most commonly-used facets pinned to the top of the list.

### Synonyms

[Synonyms]({% link live-search/synonyms.md %}) expand the reach and sharpen the focus of queries by including words shoppers might use that differ from those in the catalog. You can fine tune the synonym dictionary to keep shoppers engaged and on the path to purchase.

### Merchandising rules

Merchandising [rules]({% link live-search/rules.md %}) shape the shopping experience with if-then statements that add logic and events to search. You can easily boost or bury products for a promotion, season, or other period of time.
