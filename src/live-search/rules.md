Live Search rules shape your customers’ search experience with logic that triggers scheduled actions. You can use rules to boost, bury, pin or hide products to calibrate search results in support of your business goals.

Each rule has three main components:

Conditions – The condition(s) that trigger an action.
Actions – The action(s) that take place when the condition(s) are met.
Details – The name of the rule, and optional time frame and description.

You can combine multiple conditions and actions, and schedule a rule to be active during a specific period of time.
