title: Shipment Workflow
---

The value of the Status column in the Shipments grid reflects the state of the shipment as it moves through the workflow. If the Status column isnâ€™t currently visible in the Shipments grid, you can change the [grid layout]({% link stores/admin-grid-layout.md %}) to include the column. Then, use the [grid controls]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) to filter the shipments by status.

## Example: Show the Shipping Information column

1. On the _Admin_ menu, choose **Sales**.

1. Choose **Shipments**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click the **Columns** control.
