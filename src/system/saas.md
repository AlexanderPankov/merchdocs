Some Magento features are deployed as SaaS services. To use these services, you must connect your Magento instance to these services using an API key and a private key, and specifying the SaaS environment in the [Magento configuration]({% link configuration/services/saas.md %}).

## Magento API key and private key {#apikey}

When you create aÂ Magento account, identified by a MageID, you can generate a Magento API key and private key. To use Magento Commerce SaaS services, such as Product Recommendations, the license-holder must generate these keys in order to pass entitlement validation. These keys can then be passed to the systems integrator or development team that manages the SaaS projects and environments on behalf of the license-holder. If you are a solution integrator, you are also entitled to use these services for your own needs. In that case, the signer of the Magento partner contract should generate the keys.

### Generate an API key and private key {#genapikey}

1. Log in to your Magento account at [https://account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/){:target="_blank"}.

1. Under the **Magento** tab, select **API Portal** on the sidebar.

1. Enter a name in the **API Keys** section and click **Add New**.

   This opens a dialog for downloading the new private key.

   _Download private key_

   {:.bs-callout-warning}
   This is the only opportunity you will have to copy or download your private key.

1. Click **Download** then click **Cancel**.

   The **API Keys** section now displays your API key. You will need both the API key and private key when you [create a SaaS Environment](#createsaasenv).

## SaaS projects and environments {#saasenv}

Magento SaaS services are made up of SaaS projects and environments. SaaS projects and environments are separate but analogous concepts to Magento Cloud projects and environments. A SaaS project is a grouping of SaaS environments. A SaaS environment defines a data space that is used to collect and store data that enables Magento services to work. Some of this data may be exported from Magento and some may be collected from shopper behavior on the storefront. That data is then persisted to secure cloud storage and not to the Magento servers.

In the case of Product Recommendations, the SaaS environment contains catalog and behavioral data. You can point a Magento instance to a SaaS environment by [selecting that SaaS environment]({% link configuration/services/saas.md %}) in the Magento configuration.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
You should use your production SaaS environment only on your production Magento installation to avoid data collisions. Otherwise, you risk polluting your production site data with testing data, which will cause deployment delays. For example, your production product data could be mistakenly overwritten from staging data, such as staging URLs.

SaaS environments are designed to support multiple different websites, identified by their website codes. Data from the same website gets compiled together and separated from data from other websites. This allows you to reuse one SaaS environment by multiple Magento installations, as long as all websites have unique codes specified. Otherwise, you risk overwriting your data for the same website.

When you create a SaaS project, Magento generates one or more SaaS environments depending on whether or not you have a Magento license:

- **Magento Commerce** - One production environment; two testing environments

- **Magento Open Source** - One production environment; no testing environments

### Create SaaS Environment {#createsaasenv}

{:.bs-callout-info}
If you do not see the **Magento Services** section in the Magento configuration, you need to install the modules by running the following commands: `composer require magento/data-services` and `composer require magento/saas-export`. These modules are part of the `magento/product-recommendations` meta package.

To create a SaaS Environment, request the Magento API key from the Magento license holder for your store.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Services** and choose **Magento Services**.

1. In the _API Keys_ section, paste your key values for the **Production Api Key** and the **Production Private Key**.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Regardless of whether you are in a production environment or non-production Magento environment, always paste your key values into the **Production Api Key** and the **Production Private Key** fields.

1. Click **Save Config**.

   When you save, if there are any SaaS projects associated with your API key, those projects will appear in the **SaaS Project** field located in the **SaaS Environment** section.

1. If there are not any SaaS projects created, click the **Request New Project** to display the **Project Name** field and enter a name for your SaaS project.

   Magento creates a SaaS project and the number of SaaS environments you are entitled to.

1. Select the **SaaS Environment** to use for the current configuration of your Magento store.

To change the SaaS project or environment names, click the **Rename this Project** or **Rename this Environment** respectively.
