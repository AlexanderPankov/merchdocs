## Schedule an update to a page

1. From the *Pages* grid, open a page in edit mode.

1. In the *Scheduled Changes* box at the top of the page, click <span class="btn">Schedule New Update</span>.

1. With the **Save as a New Update** option selected, set the basic parameters for the update:

    - For **Update Name**, enter a name for the new content staging campaign.

    - Enter a brief **Description** of the update and how it is to be used.

    - Use the calendar tool to choose the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the campaign. To create an open-ended campaign, do not specify an end date (leave blank).

1. Scroll down and fill the **General Information** block with the information you need to update.

Also, you can assign current update to an existing one, select **Assign to Existing Update** and in the list, select the campaign to be modified.
