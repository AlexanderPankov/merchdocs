Your store _Admin_ is the password-protected back office where you, as the merchant, can set up products and promotions, manage orders, and perform other administrative tasks. All basic configuration tasks and store management operations are performed from the _Admin_.

For additional security, the _Admin_ login is protected by [two-factor authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication.md %}), and can be configured to require a [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}). To learn more, refer to [Configuring Admin Security]({% link stores/security-admin.md %}).

_Admin Sidebar and Dashboard_

Your initial [sign-in]({% link stores/admin-signin.md %}) credentials were set up during the installation of Adobe Commerce. If you forget your password, a temporary password can be sent to the email address that is associated with the account. For increased security, you can configure your store to require a case-sensitive user name and strong password.

In addition to the default _Admin_ account, you can create as many [additional accounts]({% link system/permissions-users-all.md %}) as needed to manage the store and support customer accounts. Each account can be associated with a specific [role]({% link system/permissions-user-roles.md %}) and [level of access]({% link system/permissions-role-resources.md %}), based on the personâ€™s business need to know. The email address that is associated with each _Admin_ account must be unique.

## Usage data collection

The first time you log in to the _Admin_, it displays the **Allow admin usage data collection** dialog.

_Allow admin usage data collection_

If you select **Allow**, Adobe Commerce will gather usage data to help improve the user experience of the _Admin_ as well as related products and services. Starting with Adobe Commerce 2.4.2, this also enables interactive _In-Product Guidance_, providing _Admin_ users with help and tips on better utilization of the product from within the _Admin_ UI. Content such as new feature announcements, walk-through guides, onboarding information, tool tips, and more will be available through this feature. The usage data cannot be used to individually identify any administrator. You can change this setting at any time from the [Admin]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}#admin-usage) configuration settings.
